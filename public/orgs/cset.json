      "What is a good way to think about CSET's impact?",
      "How net-positive can we expect CSET's work to be? How likely is CSET to do harm? In particular, how much will CSET's work draw attention to good aspects of AI Safety and fight arms races, as opposed to drawing attention in ways that might amplify arms races or dangerous AI development?",
      "Is CSET acquiring influence within the US policy community and/or the current administration?",
      "How does Jason Matheny leaving for the Biden administration affect CSET's impact? How much power and influence does Matheny have in the new Biden administration?",
      "How much influence would CSET have in a future Republican administration? Might CSET become partisan?",
      "Does CSET 's influence translate into actual policy?",
      "Are CSET's researchers well-positioned to join a future US administration?",
      "How valuable is CSET-foretell? I.e., are the predictions eventually used to make real-world decisions?",
      "What is the influence of longtermism at CSET? Can we expect this to grow or shrink in the future?",
      "To what extent should one defer to OpenPhilanthropy's evaluation of CSET? This might be more than normal, as there may be a fair amount of private knowledge, and as models around policy change (and the reasons for believing in those models) might be particularly hard to communicate."
